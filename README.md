# Interopen Hackathon

Notes from the day

Main content for the day is on the Google Spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16PGLc96aRH2ipBa79GUJJ_NYKZQv5RQPksT7g8GGELU/edit?ts=5bd2d5d6#gid=0


## Group 3 - A&E

Looking to address the admission to A&E and then discharge to the Wards.

Section G of the Spreadsheet - *In A&E, Michael is still confused and not coherent due to the seizure. The clinicians access Michael's Medical records for his problem list, allergies, and medications. Importantly they see he is a Type 2 Diabetic requiring insulin.*

What is the problem we're trying to solve:

Problem IDs: 50-55

Two stages

1. Can we get the records from the providers?
2. Can we get the data to our clinicians?

**Assumption**: The consuming organisation is OUH and therefore Cerner.
