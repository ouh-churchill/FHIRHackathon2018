# Interopen Hackathon

Notes from the day

Main content for the day is on the Google Spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16PGLc96aRH2ipBa79GUJJ_NYKZQv5RQPksT7g8GGELU/edit?ts=5bd2d5d6#gid=0]()


## Group 3 - A&E

Looking to address the admission to A&E and then discharge to the Wards.

Section G of the Spreadsheet - *In A&E, Michael is still confused and not coherent due to the seizure. The clinicians access Michael's Medical records for his problem list, allergies, and medications. Importantly they see he is a Type 2 Diabetic requiring insulin.*

What is the problem we're trying to solve:

Problem IDs: 50-55

Two stages

1. Can we get the records from the providers?
2. Can we get the data to our clinicians?

Additionally later stage, what do we hand off to the ward?

**Assumption**: The consuming organisation is OUH and therefore Cerner.
